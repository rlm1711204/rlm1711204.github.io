# Kaasu — Smart Expense Tracker (Android, free)

Type a few words, like `chai 20` or `salary 55000`, and Kaasu files each entry for you.
You can scan a bill with your camera, keep track of money you gave or took,
see reports, download them, and back everything up to **your own Google Drive**.

- **Cost:** ₹0. No Play Store, no server, no subscription.
- **Works offline:** entries are saved on the phone first.
- **Private:** your data stays on your phone and in your Google Drive. The bill photo is read on the phone and never uploaded.

## 2. Put it on your phone (one time, about 10 minutes)

The app is a website that installs like a normal app (a "PWA"). GitHub hosts it for free.

### Step A — Open Kaasu
Kaasu lives in its own public repository, **rlm1711204/rlm1711204.github.io**, which GitHub publishes automatically as your personal website:

**https://rlm1711204.github.io/**

If the address ever shows 404: open **https://github.com/rlm1711204/rlm1711204.github.io/settings/pages**, set **Source → Deploy from a branch**, **Branch → main**, folder **/ (root)**, and tap **Save**.

### Step B — Install on Android
1. Open that address in **Chrome** on your phone.
2. Tap **⋮** (top right) → **Add to Home screen** → **Install**.
   You may instead see a bar at the bottom offering to **Install**.
3. The **Kaasu** icon is now on your home screen. Open it from there. It runs full screen like any other app.

### Step B (iPhone / iPad)
iPhones don't show an "Install" button. Apple only allows installing web apps through the Share menu.
1. Open the app address in **Safari**. On iOS 16.4 and later, Chrome's Share button also works.
2. Tap the **Share** button (the square with an arrow ↑) in the bottom bar.
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**, then **Add**.
4. Always open Kaasu from the **new Home Screen icon**. The icon version keeps its own storage, separate from the Safari tab.

Kaasu also shows these steps on its Home screen when opened on an iPhone.

## 3. Save your records in Google Drive (one time, about 10 minutes)

Google makes every app get its own free "Client ID" before it can write to your Drive.

1. On a laptop (easier), open **https://console.cloud.google.com** and sign in with your Gmail.
2. Top bar → **Select a project** → **New project** → name it `Kaasu` → **Create**, then select it.
3. Search bar → type **Google Drive API** → open it → **Enable**.
4. Left menu → **Google Auth Platform** (older screens call it **OAuth consent screen**) → **Get started**:
   - App name: `Kaasu`. Support email: your Gmail.
   - Audience: **External**.
   - Contact email: your Gmail → **Create**.
5. **Audience** → **Test users** → **Add users** → add **your own Gmail** → **Save**.
6. **Clients** (or **Credentials**) → **Create client** → Application type **Web application**.
   - Under **Authorised JavaScript origins**, add exactly: `https://rlm1711204.github.io`
   - **For iPhone:** also under **Authorised redirect URIs** add exactly: `https://rlm1711204.github.io/`
     (iPhone home-screen apps can't use Google's pop-up, so Kaasu opens Google's sign-in page and comes back to this address.)
   - Tap **Create**.
7. Copy the **Client ID**. It looks like `1234567890-abc123.apps.googleusercontent.com`.
8. In the Kaasu app, open **Settings → Google Drive backup**, paste the Client ID, tap **Save Client ID**, then **Connect Google Drive**.
9. Google will say *"Google hasn't verified this app"*. That's expected, because it's your own app. Tap **Continue**, then **Allow**.

Kaasu then creates this in your Drive:

```
My Drive/
  Expense Tracker/
    expense-tracker-data.json   ← full data (used for syncing and restoring)
    All records.csv             ← opens in Google Sheets
    Reports/                    ← reports you save from the Reports screen
```

- After each entry, Kaasu saves to Drive a few seconds later.
- The top-right pill shows **Saved**.
- Google sign-in lasts about 1 hour. After that the pill says **Tap to sync**; tap it once and it continues.
- Kaasu uses Google's `drive.file` permission, so it can only see files it created, never your other Drive files.
- **New phone?** Install Kaasu, paste the same Client ID, and tap Connect. Your records come back automatically.

## 4. Screens

| Screen | What's there |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Quick-add box (type, 🎤 voice, or 📷 scan). This month's money left, spent, income, saved, budget bar, and recent entries. |
| **History** | Every entry by month, with search ("ravi", "food", "500") and filters. Tap an entry to edit or delete it. |
| **People** | Who owes you and whom you owe. Tap a person to see their history and record a repayment. |
| **Reports** | Month, 3 months, financial year (Apr–Mar) or all time. Spending by category, daily chart, 6-month income/spent/saved chart, payment modes, and insights. Downloads: **Excel (CSV)**, **PDF**, **Save to Google Drive**, **Full backup**. |
| **Settings** | Google Drive, monthly budget, light/dark theme, words Kaasu has learned, backup/restore, erase. |

### Budget plan: Needs 🧱 · Wants 🎈 · Savings 🐷
Kaasu splits your monthly income into three heads. The default is **50 / 30 / 20**. Home shows how much is **left under each head** and how much you can spend per day.

- **Automatic sorting:** every expense goes into a head by its category.
  - **Needs:** rent, groceries, bills, fuel, transport, EMI, health, education, insurance, family, home, tax.
  - **Wants:** eating out, shopping, movies, travel, personal care, gifts.
  - **Savings:** your savings entries (SIP, FD, gold, PPF…).
- **One entry is different?** Add `need` or `want` when typing (`shoes 2500 need`), or open the entry and change **Budget head**.
- **A whole category should switch?** Go to Settings → Budget plan and tap the category (e.g. make *Food* a Need).
- **Change the split:** Settings → Budget plan → **Split**. Choose 50/30/20, 60/20/20, 70/20/10, 40/30/30, 50/20/30, or **Custom** (the three numbers must add up to 100).
- **Money to plan with** = this month's income (or your fixed amount) **+/−** last month's balance (left over or shortfall) **+** money taken/got back from people **−** money given/paid back. The three heads split *this* amount, so **Needs left + Wants left + Savings to go always equals your "Money left"**. You never see money you don't have. Tap *"Split of ₹… you have this month"* to see the breakdown. If this month's salary isn't in yet, your monthly salary auto entry is used.
- **Carry forward:** the previous month's balance is carried into the next month, **whether positive or negative**. Home always shows the two parts separately, e.g. *"This month ₹66,207 − from Sept ₹35,527"*, and the budget card shows the carried line (green when money was left, red when the month was overspent). You can turn this off in Settings.

### Monthly auto entries 🔁 (rent, EMI, SIP, salary…)
Set these up once, and Kaasu adds them by itself on that day every month. You can do it in any of three ways:
- **Type it:** `rent 12000 every month on 5th`, `sip 5000 monthly on 10th`, `salary 55000 monthly on 1st`.
- **Settings → Monthly auto entries → + Add monthly entry.** Choose the type, amount, category and day.
- **Tick the box:** open any entry and tick **🔁 Repeat every month on this date**.

**Changing things later:**
- **Salary increased?** Go to Settings → Monthly auto entries, tap **Salary**, change the amount, and tap Save. Tick "Also change this month's entry" if you want the current month updated too.
- **Only one month was different?** Tap that month's entry in History and edit it. The other months aren't affected.
- **Pause** by unticking **Active**. **Stop** by tapping **Delete**. Entries that were already added stay in your history.

Auto entries are added when you open the app on or after the due day. If you open it after a few days, any missed months are filled in. They are marked 🔁 in your lists and sync to Google Drive like everything else.

### Reports → By item name
Every entry with the same name is added up, so you can see what one thing costs you over time: **Milk ₹120 (3×, avg ₹40)**, **Gym subscription ₹2,500**, **Sabji ₹210 (2×)**. Small spelling differences are matched automatically (Milk / milk / Milks; Eggs / egg). Search for an item, or tap a row to see every entry behind it.

### Money given to someone, not a loan 🎁
For money you give and won't ask back (helping Manoj, a gift for Dilmaan), add the word **gift** or **no return**:

```
gave manoj 500 gift
gave dilmaan 2000 no return
```

It's saved as a normal **expense** (so it counts in your spending and budget), but it remembers the person. **Reports → 🎁 Spent on people** shows the cumulative total per person, and tapping a name lists every entry.

You can also add a name to any expense: open the entry and fill in **Spent on (optional)**.

Without the word "gift", `gave manoj 500` is still treated as a **loan** and appears on the **People** tab, where you can record repayments.

### 🤖 AI bill reading (optional, free with Gemini)
Add an AI key in **Settings → AI bill reading**, the same way as in the SSC Vocab Vault app:

- **Google Gemini (free):** open **aistudio.google.com/apikey** → **Create API key** → paste it in Kaasu → **Add**. No card needed. Add a key from a second Gmail too, and Kaasu switches to it automatically when the first reaches its free daily limit.
- **Claude (optional, paid):** a key from **console.anthropic.com**. Used only when Gemini can't read a file.

With a key:
- **Photos of bills** are read far more accurately: shop, total, date, items, category, payment mode and GST.
- **📄 PDF** (new button on the scan screen):
  - **A PDF bill or invoice** (Swiggy, Amazon, electricity…) opens the usual check screen.
  - **A statement** (PhonePe, Paytm, bank) shows **every transaction in a list**. Untick anything you don't want, fix a category with the drop-down (Kaasu remembers it), then tap **Add**. Entries you already typed (same day, same amount) are unticked, so nothing is counted twice.

**Itemised bills** (Instamart, Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, supermarket bills) become **one entry per item**:
- Each item gets its name, price, category and **🧱 Need / 🎈 Want**. Tap the chip to switch it, or the drop-down to change the category.
- Unavailable or struck-out items are skipped.
- Delivery/handling fees, discounts and round-off go into one **"Delivery & fees"** line, so the items add up **exactly** to the bill's Grand Total. The screen shows ✅ when they match, plus the Needs/Wants split.
- Prefer one entry? Tap **One entry for the bill**.
- Scanning the same bill twice is caught: items already saved are unticked.

**Two Gemini keys?** Choose **Auto** (Key 1, then Key 2 when Key 1 reaches its free limit), **Key 1 only** or **Key 2 only**, on the scan screen or in Settings.

**Privacy:** keys are stored only on that phone. They're never synced to Google Drive or included in backups. When AI is used, the photo or PDF is sent to Google (Gemini) or Anthropic (Claude) to be read. Without a key, photos are read on the phone as before.

### Scanning a bill 📷
1. Tap the scan button → **Take photo** (or **Choose from gallery**).
2. Kaasu reads the bill on your phone and fills in the **total**, **date**, **shop name** and **category**. It also shows the **GST** amount and the shop's **GSTIN**.
3. Check the details and tap **Save**.

The first scan needs internet (about 10 MB, downloaded once). For best results, lay the bill flat in good light and fill the screen with it.

### PDF report
**Reports → PDF report** opens the print screen. Choose **Save as PDF** as the printer, then tap the download button.

## 5. Common problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| GitHub Pages shows 404 | Wait 2 minutes after a change. Check Settings → Pages shows branch **main**, folder **/ (root)**. |
| No "Install" option | Use **Chrome**, not an in-app browser (WhatsApp/Instagram). Open the link directly. |
| Google says `redirect_uri_mismatch` or `origin not allowed` | In Google Cloud → Clients → your client, the JavaScript origin must be exactly `https://rlm1711204.github.io` (no `/my-cloud-test`, no slash at the end). Changes take up to 5 minutes. |
| Google says `access_denied` | Add your Gmail under **Audience → Test users** (Section 3, step 5). |
| Pill says "Tap to sync" | Normal after about an hour. Tap it once. |
| Bill total is wrong | Just correct it before saving. Retake the photo straight on, with less shadow. |
| Voice button doesn't work | Allow the microphone for Chrome, or use the 🎤 on your keyboard. |
| Two phones show different data | Both phones must be connected with the **same Gmail** and the **same Client ID**. Check Settings → Google Drive backup on each phone: it shows the Gmail and the last 6 characters of the Client ID. Then tap **Sync now** on phone A, then phone B, then phone A again. |
| iPhone: Google says `redirect_uri_mismatch` | Add `https://rlm1711204.github.io/` under **Authorised redirect URIs** of your Client ID (Section 3, step 6) and wait 5 minutes. |
| iPhone: no "Add to Home Screen" | Use **Safari** (or Chrome on iOS 16.4+) → Share → scroll down. In-app browsers (WhatsApp, Instagram) don't show it: open the link in Safari first. |
| Changed phones or cleared Chrome data | If Drive was connected, reconnect and your data returns. Otherwise use **Settings → Restore from file** with a downloaded backup. |

**Tip:** once a month, tap **Settings → Download backup** as an extra safety copy.

## 6. For the curious — how it's built

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There's no build step and nothing to install on a computer.

```
(repository root)
  index.html            the screens
  css/styles.css        design (light + dark)
  js/parser.js          understands "chai 20", "gave ravi 2000", and bill text
  js/store.js           saves entries on the phone, does the maths, CSV export
  js/charts.js          charts (no libraries)
  js/ocr.js             reads bills (Tesseract.js, runs on the phone)
  js/drive.js           Google Drive sync
  js/app.js             connects everything
  sw.js                 lets it open offline
  manifest.webmanifest  makes it installable
  tests/                run: node tests/parser.test.js
```

To add your own keywords, open `js/parser.js` and add words to the category lists at the top.
For example, add `'kumar mess'` to **Food**.
